                    <h3>Underpass Park</h3>
                    <p>Underpass Park is Toronto's most distinctive and beloved skate spot, situated beneath the <b>Eastern Avenue</b> overpass in the heart of downtown. The park, established in 2012, has turned a forsaken space into a thriving skater, BMX, and city artist community. It's a combination of ledges, rails, banks, and manual pads, offering the ideal setup for street skating.

                        What makes Underpass Park special is that it can be accessed regardless of the weather, since the highway above provides a shelter from rain and snow. It also serves as a cultural meeting point, with lively graffiti murals adding to its downtown appeal. This makes it a must-visit for skaters in Toronto.</p>
